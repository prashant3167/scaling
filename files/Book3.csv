Observation,"With TAND, we are now able to support 100 more devices (earlier it was 500).This is due to saving in RAM and comparatively less CPU usage","With TAND, the RAM usage is reduced by close to 40%.Though we have resources to scale further, we hit influx db bottle neck.Though we have resources to scale further, we hit influx db bottle neck.System was very stable and seamless for two days.But, memory leak occurred in the third day and system hit 100% RAM and CPU."
